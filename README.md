3. Some of the best VPS Trial websites: linode, microsoft azure, vultr, digitalocean.
4. Third thing you will have to do is to download nodejs and npm on your server(s) you can find a tutorial on google ;)
5. Fourth thing you need to do is to download the hyper.js script I gave you and put it on your server(s).
6. Sixth thing you need to do is to connect your server(s) to the program by typing your host IP's and passwords in config.json.
7. If you don't have 4 servers you can just leave it blank or if you have more servers you can add them yourself. You will need to write some code in the program but you already have everything, you can just copy what I did.
